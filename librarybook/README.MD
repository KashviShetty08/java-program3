Library Book Stack Management System

A simple Java console project that simulates how a stack of books works in a library — where the last book you place on top is the first one you take out (LIFO).

It’s a great little project for learning how stack data structures, arrays, and basic object-oriented programming work in Java.

What This Project Does
Create a new stack with a custom size
Start with a preloaded list of book IDs
Push one or two books onto the stack
Pop one or multiple books from the stack
View all books currently on the stack
See only the top few books
Handles overflow and underflow conditions gracefully

How to Run

Open your Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, or VS Code).
Create a new Java project called LibraryBook.
Inside the src folder, make a package named:

Add both files:

LibraryStack.java

Stack.java

Run the LibraryStack class.
